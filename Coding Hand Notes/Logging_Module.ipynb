    "### Root Logger\n",
    "`root` means the root logger. Root logger is good for smaller applications, but it can be inefficient if the application gets bigger. When you import a module, it actually runs the code in that module you imported. The logger used if applicable will be based on the module you imported as well.<br>\n",
    "If you have `logging.basicConfig` in the imported module, and you have another one in the working module(where you import into) then the working module’s basicConfig will be based on the imported, and it does not overwrite imported’s. To solve this, create different logger for each module.\n"
